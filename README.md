To clone your disk with Clonezilla, especially given the critical nature of your software and the skipped `sdb8` partition issue, follow these steps for the **best Clonezilla options** to ensure a complete and reliable disk clone:

---

### **1. Prepare Clonezilla Environment**
1. Download Clonezilla Live: [Clonezilla Download Page](https://clonezilla.org/downloads.php).
2. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) or `Etcher`.
3. Boot the machine from the Clonezilla Live USB.

### **2. Select the Best Clonezilla Options**

When prompted during the Clonezilla interface, choose the following options:

#### **Device-to-Device Disk Cloning (Full Disk Clone)**
1. Select `device-device` mode for cloning the entire disk.
   - This clones the entire disk bit-by-bit, including all partitions, bootloader, and metadata.

2. Choose `Beginner Mode` for simplicity.

#### **Important Options to Enable:**
1. **Clone Entire Disk**:
   - Select the source disk (`sdb`) and the target disk (`sdc`).

2. **Enable Bit-by-Bit Cloning**:
   - Enable the option for `-q1` (sector-by-sector copy). This ensures hidden or unrecognized partitions (like `sdb8`) are copied without skipping.

   > **Option to Select**: `Use dd to clone disk`  
   This ensures a 1:1 copy of all data, including empty space, boot sectors, and non-standard partitions.

3. **Skip Checking/Repairing Filesystems**:
   - When prompted, choose to skip checking or repairing the filesystem. This avoids Clonezilla modifying or skipping problematic partitions like `sdb8`.

4. **Partition Table and UUID Handling**:
   - When asked how to handle the partition table:
     - Select `-k1` (keep and copy the partition table as-is).
   - When asked about UUIDs:
     - Choose `-u` (keep the original UUIDs).

### **3. Post-Cloning Steps**
After the cloning process completes:

1. **Verify Partitions**:
   - Boot from a live Linux environment and run:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc
     ```
   Ensure all partitions, including `sdb8`, are present on `sdc`.

2. **Verify Software Activation**:
   - Boot from the cloned disk (`sdc`) and check if the software runs without activation errors.

---

### **4. Troubleshooting Clonezilla Issues**
If the software still shows activation errors:

1. **Manual UUID Copying**:
   - Check UUIDs:
     ```bash
     sudo blkid
     ```
   - If UUIDs are different, match them as follows:
     ```bash
     sudo tune2fs /dev/sdc8 -U $(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sdb8)
     ```

2. **Disk Serial Number Matching**:
   Some software checks the disk’s serial number. This usually requires hardware-specific tools. If your disk supports it, use `hdparm` or similar utilities.

3. **Clone Specific Partitions (If Needed)**:
   If `sdb8` is problematic, use Clonezilla’s advanced partition-cloning mode to explicitly copy `sdb8` to `sdc8`.

By carefully selecting these options in Clonezilla, you should achieve a complete and error-free clone of `sdb` to `sdc`. Let me know if you need further assistance!
