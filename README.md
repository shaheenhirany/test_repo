### Detailed Discussion Points

#### 1. Course Overview and Purpose

- **Target Audience and Focus:**  
  As discussed, this course is designed primarily for Master’s and PhD students within the Community Health Sciences department who aim to gain in-depth knowledge of digital health interventions in public health and epidemiology. The emphasis is on training students to use digital health tools (e.g., e-health, m-health) for data collection, analysis, and public health monitoring.

- **Purpose and Relevance of Digital Health in Modern Epidemiology:**  
  It was highlighted that digital health has transformed traditional data collection methods in public health, moving from paper-based forms to digital tools like RADCAP. This shift is particularly relevant for epidemiological studies and public health initiatives in resource-limited settings. As suggested, the course will cover essential digital health applications including mobile data collection, geospatial monitoring, and ethical considerations to help students adapt these tools effectively in public health interventions.

#### 2. Core Competencies and Learning Outcomes

- **Core Competencies:**  
  The course will develop several core competencies, including:
    - **Critical Thinking and Knowledge:** Students will develop a theoretical foundation in digital health concepts, such as e-health, m-health, and telehealth.
    - **Technical Skills:** Practical skills will be developed through hands-on practice with applications like RADCAP and tools for geospatial analysis. As discussed, students will gain familiarity with the use of digital tools within low-resource contexts.
    - **Communication Skills:** The course emphasizes clear, effective information exchange, preparing students to communicate health data and findings.
    - **Professionalism:** Students are expected to develop an understanding of professionalism, demonstrating qualities like honesty, respect, and empathy in digital health scenarios.

- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  As suggested, the learning outcomes will prepare students to:
    - **Analyze and Apply Digital Health Tools:** Students will apply digital health systems for clinical care, surveillance, and public health decision-making.
    - **Critically Evaluate Digital Health Challenges:** The course will encourage students to analyze digital health challenges, particularly within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using real-world case studies.
    - **Ethical Considerations in Digital Health:** The program will also include training on the ethical and privacy concerns associated with digital health tools, ensuring students can navigate these complex issues.

#### 3. Student Requirements, Assessment, and Grading

- **Attendance Requirements:**  
  Attendance was set at a minimum of 75% due to the interactive and blended structure of the course, as discussed. Students are expected to attend synchronous sessions and complete asynchronous work to meet course requirements.

- **Grading Policies and Assessment Types:**  
  The course will feature multiple assessment types, including:
    - **Quizzes:** Two quizzes will be held, each worth 10% of the grade. As agreed, these will focus on both short-answer and multiple-choice questions administered through the BLE platform.
    - **Group Project Assignments:** Students will complete two major assignments:
      - **Assignment 1:** Due October 3rd, requiring students to identify a health-related topic and perform a literature search, contributing 15% to the grade.
      - **Assignment 2:** Due December 5th, focused on research methodology, the application of geospatial tools, and data visualization, also worth 15%.
    - **Project Presentation:** As discussed, a final project presentation will be held on December 12th. This will allow students to demonstrate their findings and application of digital health tools, accounting for 20% of the grade.
    - **Penalties for Late Submission:** As agreed, there will be a clear penalty system, deducting 5% for submissions late by 24 hours, 10% after 48 hours, and a maximum deduction of 25% for submissions over 72 hours late.

#### 4. Module Breakdown and Session Formats

- **Overview of Modules and Their Content:**  
  The course structure includes four primary modules, each focusing on specific aspects of digital health:
    - **Module 1: Introduction to Digital Health**  
      Focused on fundamental digital health concepts and the applications of m-health and e-health, this module combines in-person and asynchronous sessions, as suggested, to provide a foundation for subsequent modules.
    - **Module 2: Digital Health Concepts and Applications**  
      As discussed, this module covers practical applications and includes hands-on exercises using software like RADCAP and geospatial tools. A blend of synchronous online sessions and asynchronous content will allow for flexible engagement.
    - **Module 3: Tools and Technologies in Digital Health**  
      Emphasis will be on practical skills, with lab sessions to facilitate the use of wearable devices, REDCAP, and data visualization tools for public health monitoring. Faculty suggested integrating this module with field exercises.
    - **Module 4: Nutrition and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**  
      Focusing on public health nutrition, stunting, and the dual burden of malnutrition, this module will include a detailed exploration of nutrition assessment tools and epidemiology, as discussed.

- **Session Format and Blended Learning Approach:**  
  The course utilizes a blended approach, with a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions to accommodate different learning styles. As suggested, some sessions will feature in-person workshops, particularly for tools and technologies that require hands-on practice.

#### 5. Course Materials and Suggested Supplemental Tools

- **Primary Course Materials:**  
  Key resources include digital health tool guides and epidemiology textbooks. RADCAP documentation and other digital health guides will be available on the BLE platform. As discussed, the reading list will emphasize practical applications relevant to LMICs.

- **Supplemental Resources and Suggested Adjustments:**  
  Faculty members suggested providing alternative texts for foundational topics in epidemiology to make content accessible for students with varying levels of prior knowledge. Suggested books include entry-level epidemiology texts that cover the fundamentals of public health data and digital health interventions.

#### 6. Faculty Roles, Teaching Assistance, and Course Support

- **Roles and Responsibilities of Faculty Members:**  
  Faculty are assigned specific modules, with backup instructors identified to ensure seamless course delivery. As agreed, faculty will lead both in-person and online sessions, with TAs supporting student interactions on BLE, assisting with grading, and providing guidance on technical issues.

- **Teaching Assistant Support Structure:**  
  A dedicated team of TAs will be involved to aid in managing asynchronous and in-person engagement, grading, and technical troubleshooting, especially in practical modules that require the use of software tools. As suggested, TAs will also provide students with additional resources for review.

- **Guest Lecturers and Additional Sessions:**  
  As suggested, guest lecturers with expertise in big data and NLP will be invited to provide insights into current trends in public health informatics. These sessions are intended to broaden students’ understanding and practical application of health data technologies.

#### 7. Decisions & Action Items

- **Attendance Policy Finalization:**  
  The attendance policy for blended learning will be discussed with Mr. Shahzad to confirm that it aligns with the course’s blended approach, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous requirements.

- **Integration of Life Course Perspective in Nutrition Module:**  
  As discussed, faculty recommended adding a life course perspective within the nutrition module to broaden understanding of the implications of nutrition on NCDs at various life stages. This adjustment aims to make the content more cohesive and aligned with public health objectives.

- **Reading List and Course Materials Review:**  
  Faculty members will review and finalize the reading list, with an emphasis on accessible resources that cater to varying student backgrounds. A feedback loop will be incorporated to assess the utility of the selected materials.

- **August Feedback Session:**  
  A feedback session is scheduled for August, during which faculty will provide further input on the course structure, materials, and assessment plan. As agreed, this session will also address any final adjustments needed before the course outline is shared with students.
